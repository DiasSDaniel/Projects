## Using a Random Forest Classifier to recognize handwritten characters from the Stanford OCR dataset

This project has learning purposes. It is an attempt to create a good multi-class classification model, witch can recognize handwritten letters from the Stanford OCR dataset. By doing so, improving my machine learning skills and ability to apply ML theory to different scenarios.

### The Stanford OCR dataset

The original dataset can be found at "http://ai.stanford.edu/~btaskar/ocr/".

It contains handwritten words collected by Rob Kassel at MIT Spoken Language Systems Group. For the purpose of this project, the information about letter position (wich provides the information of the words) is not used. Therefore, we were left with a dataset composed of 52.152 lowercase lettlers.

### Dependencies

This project was made using Python 3.10. The following librarys were used:
- Matplotlip
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
